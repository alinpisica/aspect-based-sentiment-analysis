I liked the food.
The worst oysters salad
The drinks were pretty nice, but I absolutely loved the waitress.
The duck breast special was TREMENDOUS! LOVE LOVE LOVE XOXOXO
Service is the best in town
I waited 10 minutes for just a glass of water 
Even though is hard to mess up eggs, it was an awful breakfast.
The drinks were awesome. Cake was pretty salty, could've been sweeter

The food was amazing. The soda was awful. I loved the french fries and the pasta carbonara
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the steamed mussels with baked potatos
The waiter was sloppy... The soup was salty... 
Delivery was faster than expected
I liked the steak, but the orange juice was awful.
The drinks were horrible. The food was like the drinks.

Great Asian restaurant! The food is delicious. The portions are huge, so when they have the option for half an entree I would recommend going for that.
The tom yum was very flavorful and packed with lots of prawns.  I was shocked at the how good the quality of the food is here
I had the green thai curry and it was perfect aaand it was massive, and a delicious curry sauce!
The food i have had has not been anything special. It is not that it is not nice but i wouldn't be running back for it. 
The food is excellent. I highly recommend the Duck - very tasty!
